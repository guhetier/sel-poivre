# Instructions

- Cut the cold butter in small chunks.
- Mix the butter with the flour and salt until integrated, by hand or using a food processor.
- Add the water. Mix only enough for the dough to bind. Mixing more will make the dough chewy.
- Wrap in plastic film and chill for at least 15min (1h is better).
- Roll thin on a floured surface.
